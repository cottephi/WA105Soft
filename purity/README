   How to run the code for purity measurement
------------------------------------------------

You can find the following directories:

inc
src
work

the Makefile (and this README).

1) run make to get purity.exe (if needed)

> make

2) enter in work directory
 
>  cd work
>  ls -rtl
  
   purity.sh --> script to be used
   purity.exe -> ../purity.exe  --> link to executable
   input  --> directory for scripts and macros needed by purity.sh , you do not need to modify it
  
   
3) now you need to link a root file of recostructed data, reco.root

4) to run the code:
   source purity.sh reco.root
   
    
   this create a directory: purity_reco_ddmmyy_hhmmss
   
   in purity_reco_ddmmyy_hhmmss there are two relevant files:
   
   --> fitresult_ddmmyy_hhmmss.listing: ascii file with purity values for view 0 and view1 obtained from fit
   
   --> purity_ddmmyy_hhmmss.listing:: general information about input file (reco.root)
   
    A pdf file,  purity_ddmmyy_hhmmss.pdf is also available
    
    
Please note that the scripts ends in a root session
